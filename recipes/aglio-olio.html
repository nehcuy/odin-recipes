    <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
        <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
            Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally
            until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
            Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine garlic and olive oil in a cold skillet.
            Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes.
            Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble.
            Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes.
            Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt into the pasta.
            Pour in olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and
            half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; stir until combined.
        </li>
        <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
